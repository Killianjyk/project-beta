## Design

## Service microservice

I created 3 models: Appointment, Technician, and AutomobileVO. These models then were used to create an encoder. The respectful encoders AppointmentEncoder, TechnicianEncoder, and AutomobileVOEncoder were used in my view functions. These encoders help us get information from our models to use into our view functions. These view functions are used for backend and frontend purposes. We incorporated Insomnia to check if our backend was correct. Moving onto frontend, we created js files. We used jsx to help launch our website.

## Sales microservice
