## Design

## Service microservice

I created 3 models: Appointment, Technician, and AutomobileVO. The we created AppointmentEncoder, TechnicianEncoder, and AutomobileVOEncoder were used in my view functions. These encoders help us get information from our models to use into our view functions. These view functions are used for backend and frontend purposes. We incorporated Insomnia to check if our backend was correct. As for poller, I updated that file to grab information about an automobile from inventory to update my automobileVO. Moving onto frontend, we created js files. We used jsx to help launch our website.
